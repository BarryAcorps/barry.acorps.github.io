  <h1 class="contentTitle">About Me</h1>
  
  <p>Hi, welcome to my About Me section. I&rsquo;m trying to abridge this as much as possible so I don&rsquo;t overshare, so perhaps I&rsquo;ll just do sections as if I&rsquo;m interviewed.</p>
<h1 id="tell-me-about-yourself">Tell Me About Yourself.</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>Barry Acorps</strong>, but you can just call me Barry. Obviously, I&rsquo;m a dude, but I&rsquo;m still a minor. I&rsquo;m from the Philippines &#x1f1f5;&#x1f1ed;, and my birthday is on February 20 &#x2653;.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to study STEM related subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science. When I&rsquo;m not studying, I&rsquo;m playing <strong>Rhythm Games</strong>, like <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> or <em>maimai</em>; <strong>Precise Platformers or Metroidvanias</strong>, like <em>Celeste</em> or <em>Hollow Knight</em>; or Puzzle Games, which extend to actual puzzle games or online riddles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been coding ever since I was 8, when I made my first ever HTML-based website. Nowadays, I&rsquo;m using my skills to write stories and develop mediums for it. You can check out my works at <a href="/works">my works page.</a></p>
<h1 id="what-have-you-accomplished">What Have You Accomplished?</h1>
<p>All of my accomplishments so far are in my real life though. Without the details, I&rsquo;ve participated in academic competitions. One of them, I got lucky and I made it to the semi-finals of a math competition.</p>
<p>When it comes to gaming, I did 100% Celeste Steam Achievements, 100% Base Game Hollow Knight, Full Combo&rsquo;d a Level 15 Chart in DDR (MAX 300), Complete the challenge in The Witness, and solved Polychromasia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll soon fill up this section, some day.</p>
<h2 id="describe-your-inspirations">Describe Your Inspirations.</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding inspirations in my projects, I go back to story-driven games. I&rsquo;m interested in Mystery Visual Novel games, such as the Ace Attorney series and the Zero Escape series. I also like to find inspiration on games with good soundtracks, such as Deltarune and the Touhou Project. I&rsquo;d like to think of Toby Fox as an inspiration on my work.</p>
<h2 id="what-music-do-you-listen-to">What Music Do You Listen To?</h2>
<p>I listen to breakcore; the 2000s kind though, not the modern stuff. I mostly listen to DnB, experimental, and some miscellaneous stuff here and there. Of course, I&rsquo;m no stranger to RHythm game music too.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of my favorite artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine Girl</li>
<li>Venetian Snares</li>
<li>bye2</li>
<li>Inabakumori</li>
<li>Daft Punk</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-can-i-reach-you">Where Can I Reach You?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ-Ogmz2tKTgI10Ci26UMYQ">Youtube (Barry Acorps)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/BarryAcorps">Twitter (@BarryAcorps)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to reach me, just send me a DM through my Twitter DMs or through my Discord (@barryacorps). <strong>PLEASE notify me that you are contacting me from my website or else I will treat it as spam.</strong></p>
<h3 id="anything-else">Anything Else?</h3>
<p>If you find me in an online server, please don&rsquo;t be hesitant to talk to me. I&rsquo;m a bit socially inept, but I&rsquo;m willing to meet new people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, thanks for reading.</p>
